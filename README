This is an assignment I've been doing to create a PHP based CMS to allow CSS and valid XHTML to be integrated. 

Currently the timestamp system from the database doesnt work and the home page is static. Database is set up on a db called 'serverside' working in table 'CMS'.

Have downloading Tiny_MCE js framework to incorporate a WSYIWG into the CMS.
